# PID Ki Optimization using Metaheuristics and Ensembles

This repository contains Python implementations of several optimization algorithms applied to the tuning of the **Ki** parameter in PID controllers. The goal is to minimize the **Integral of Time-weighted Absolute Error (ITAE)**.

### Optimization Methods:
- Grid Search
- Random Search
- Genetic Algorithm (GA)
- Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
- Ensemble Methods (Mean, Median, Weighted)

### Associated Publication:
This code supports the experiments described in the manuscript:

> "**Enhanced PID Control for Induction Motor Drives: Classical and Intelligent Tuning Approaches**"  
> Targeted for submission to Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research
